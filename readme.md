## To Do

Currently textract for some reason only detects correctly the PDF encodings if the filenames ends with the correct extension.

I want it to be enough with the correct MIME types from sources, so this must be fixed somehow.

By the moment, as most of the files are pdfs, i just named the temporary file "tmp.pdf".


## Dependencies:

- Ubuntu
-- apt-get install libpulse-dev
-- pip3 install textract
